**Mirror**
The application component to a digital mirror which appears on the monitor.  It has three sections _Home, Schedule,_ and _Settings_.


**Home**
A basic landing page that displays the date, time, and weather.

**Schedule**

**Settings**
The settings tab can change the time the mirror goes to sleep and wakes up.
